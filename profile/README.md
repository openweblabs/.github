Open Web Labs is a non-profit organization that takes great inspiration from the Open Web Foundation. We try to apply these same principles to the newly emerging web3 technologies.

"The Open Web Foundation is an independent non-profit dedicated to the development and protection of open, non-proprietary specifications for web technologies.   Following the open source model similar to the Creative Commons, the foundation is aimed at building a lightweight framework to help communities deal with the legal requirements necessary to create successful and widely adopted specifications.

The foundation is hoping to break the trend of creating separate legal entities to support individual specifications, coming out of the realization that we could come together and generalize our efforts."
